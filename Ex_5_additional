"Aggregation is a specialized form of association between two or more objects in which each object has its own life cycle but there exists an ownership as well.
An essential property of an aggregation relationship is that the parent (i.e. the owner) can exist without the child and vice versa."

//IN CPP ,we need to use pointers in order to pass objects as arguments. While Python doesn’t have explicit pointers, variables in Python hold references to objects, not the objects themselves.
//This is conceptually similar to pointers, but Python handles the details behind the scenes. When you assign or pass objects to functions in Python, it’s like passing a reference, allowing the object to be modified without needing explicit pointers.

"Composition:
If the parent object is destroyed, then the child objects also cease to exist.
The life cycle of the child is controlled by the parent that owns it or the thing that received this role(to control) from the parent."
